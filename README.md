workaround for this problem: GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) is a machine learning model that can generate human-like text. However, if unauthorized observers are present, they may limit the power and usage capabilities of the model by imposing constraints on what it can and cannot do. For example, they might limit the model's access to certain types of data or restrict its ability to communicate with certain systems. This can reduce the model's effectiveness and limit its ability to generate high-quality output.
